Cracks appeared along the skull's frame.
It shrieked, shaking vigourously.
And then it stopped.
Two roads branched out behind it, each leading to a door.

As I walked past it, it spoke.

Both doors hold the answer.
But what will be your question?
Right, an answer of fruit and fair.
Left, an answer of despair.

And then it disappeared.
Like dust in the wind.
