The 'me' before my eyes starts to crack.
It doesn't shout.
Doesn't scream.
It doesn't say anything.
It only held its gaze with mine.
Until it disappears.
Behind it, I can see a light.
Shining brighter than any light I've seen before.
My legs move on its own.
And I move forward without looking back once.
