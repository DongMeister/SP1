A single floating orb stood between me and the gate. 
I would have ignored it and head straight to the door 
if it weren't for the ominous presence emitting from it.
Trouble.
It changes shape, albeit slowly. It didn't take too long for it to finish. 
It's black form cracked, revealing a white surface beneath it. Bones.
A skull, two to three times larger than me, looked down upon me. 
Questions escapes it's form, 
with a voice stronger than any of the ones I've faced before.
