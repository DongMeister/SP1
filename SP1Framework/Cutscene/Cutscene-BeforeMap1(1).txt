Walls several times taller than me rose from the ground, if there ever was one;
there was only darkness beneath my feet. 
I don't know how I am standing, but I am. 
There are places where the walls don't rise, forming a road before me. 
It seems I have to get to the end of this room.
No other choice but to move forward.
A blur of movement flashed past me, and disappeared around a corner. 
My heart was gripped with fear.
It was clear to me that I wasn't alone.
