It would seem that I'm in the right direction.
Well, not like there's any other directions to go to.
I look at the linear road I'm in after exiting the maze. 
At the end of it there's another gate, similar to the one I first saw.
I wonder if that means there's more of those mazes.
"...Abel."
Huh? Did I just hear my name?
I look around. There's nothing but me, the walls and the gate.
I must be hearing things.
