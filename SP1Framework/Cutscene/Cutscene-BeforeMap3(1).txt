"Abel."
There it is again. I'm pretty sure I'm not hearing things.
"Who's there." My voice sounds hoarser than I'd expect.
From the walls darkness seeps out. It pools before me, rising in the middle. 
It stops rising at my height. Slowly, it takes form as a human. 
Its the same creature like the ones I faced just moments before. 
I should be afraid, but why? 
Why do I feel some sort of familiarity?
It's orbs for eyes levels with mine. There was no emotion when it spoke.
"I see. You.. don't remember..." 
It reaches out for me and another flood of memories drowns me for a moment.
The door opens before me. 
Hard light falls onto my face, causing me to shield my eyes in reflex. 
When it settles down, tables filled with people greets my sights. 
Only when I felt the slight tug of my hand, I noticed someone beside me.
The memories end.
The feelings I experienced was unlike the first time it happened.
It was warm, and it left me wanting for more. 
I look up, only to realize that the creature is gone. 
Surprisingly, the gate was open.
Who am I, really? Who are these creatures? 
Several questions bounced in my head, but had come to a temporary conclusion.
If I want to know more, I'd need to progress further.
