It stands between me and the gate. 
It was the same one that I’ve met between mazes. 
I didn’t see it in the previous corridor. 
So this is where it went to. 
We were only a few steps away but I could feel a hint of anger emitting from it.
“Out of the way.” I hissed.
I’m so close to the gate. 
This is the final level, I know it. 
I need to get back.
I won’t let anything stop me.
