This time, the gate was much bigger. Weird. Just like the sound It makes.
Just like before, It seeps out from the walls again. 
I'll probably never get used to seeing that. 
It stands before me again and stares into my eyes for an unusually long time. 
It speaks after a while of silence.
"No.. Questions..?"
Ah.
"Who am I?"
A pause, and a wave of emotions crash into me again, 
including several scenes of what probably is from a lost memory.
Fire. Standing before a gravestone, words on it were blurred, 
as if I wasn't supposed to remember. 
Classroom. Torn paper. Rage. Silence.
Just as suddenly, the memories end. 
Tears stream down from my face. I remember that scene The gate is open.
I need to find out who I really am. To do that I need to get out of here.
