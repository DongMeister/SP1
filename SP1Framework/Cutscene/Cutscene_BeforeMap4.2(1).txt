This time, the gate was much bigger. 
Weird. Just like the sound It makes.
Just like before, It seeps out from the walls again. 
I'll probably never get used to seeing that. 
It stands before me again and stares into my eyes for an unusually long time.
It speaks after a while of silence.
"No.. Questions..?"
Ah.
I want to know.
"Who are you?"
This time, the silence is longer. 
It was probably lasted for a good thirty seconds before it lifted it's arm,
 pointing at me, before pointing back to itself.
Then, It disappeared.
Huh? I was dumbfounded. 
Did it mean me?
Creakkkk.
I turn my head towards the sound, and saw the gate open. 
I move towards it.
What exactly did it mean? I need to know. 
Who I am doesn't seem important anymore.
