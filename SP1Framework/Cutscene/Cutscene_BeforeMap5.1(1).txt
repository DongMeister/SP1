It waited behind the gates for the first time. 
Normally it would have seeped out from the walls after I entered the room. 
It was as if it knew I would find my way and reach the gates.
It was automatic now. 
Standing before it, 
I braced myself for the wave of memories that come a brief moment later.
Two figures. Relief when I see them. A girl. Auburn. Laughter. 
Sunset behind her. First kiss. Tears of joy. Cloud nine. Bright lights. 
Red carpet. Formally dressed man at the end.
I was crying when the memory ended. This time, tears of happiness. 
The gate at the end waited for my entry.
I should be nearing the end soon.
