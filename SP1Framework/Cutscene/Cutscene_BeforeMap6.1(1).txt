It doesn’t wait for me at the gates, 
nor does it seep out from the walls this time. 
The gate is closed.
This is strange. 
The room feels different.
The next wave of memories stop me from thinking. 
It was big, as if it holds what the creature couldn’t show me. 
I was laughing, screaming, shouting and crying all at the same time. 
The memories played out in my head like a movie. 
One moment I was looking at the scene of my marriage, 
the next moment I was looking at my parents’ graves, 
and another I found myself driving my car, Auburn right beside me. 
Then the headlights of another car to my left.
When it was all over, I finally remembered.
It was on my wedding day. I was driving Auburn to our new home. 
While we were driving through a four-way intersection, 
another car crashed into ours. 
That’s where the memories ended.
I ran towards the gate, and pushed it open.
