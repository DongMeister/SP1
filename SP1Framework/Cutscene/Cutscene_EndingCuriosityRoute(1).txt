I see it.
Its staring at me once again.
“Who are you?” I ask once more.
Slowly, a part of It’s body falls of, 
followed by other parts of It’s body. 
When its done, terror grips me. I’m looking at myself. 
A part of myself, to be exact. 
There was no hint of happiness in ‘my’ eyes, only sadness.
I didn’t notice the blight on my skin spreading throughout my body. 
It was painless. 
I didn’t notice it until most of my body was covered. 
As the last of me is engulfed by the blight, 
I realized the meaning of It’s actions previously, 
even if I never understood anything else.
I am you, and you are me.
