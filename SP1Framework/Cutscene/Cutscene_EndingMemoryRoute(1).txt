My eyes open.
A dull, white wall meet my sights. 
It would seem that I was in the hospital.
I tried to sit myself up, but to no avail. 
Most of my body was bandaged up, or in a cast. 
Probably because of that damn car crash.
A figure beside my bed caught my eye. 
I recognized her almost instantly.
Auburn
Thank god. She’s alive.
A nurse enters the room, and upon seeing my open eyes, she ran back outside. 
Presumably to get a doctor.
I look towards the sleeping Auburn again, and softly, I call her name. 
She responds with a slight growl, 
before sitting up and wiping the tears off her eyes.
“Its time for you to wake up.” 
I replied her with the same reply I give her every time. 
She froze when she heard it. 
She looks at me, her face a mix of relief and disbelief.
Her eyes watering. I give a slow nod.
She holds my face close to hers. 
She calls my name again and again, 
as if to confirm that she isn’t dreaming and that I’m still alive.
“Yeah. I’m back.”
We stay like that for a very long time, even after the doctor enters the room.
