My eyes open.
A dull, white wall meet my sights. 
It was moments later that I realized that it was the ceiling. 
I look around. 
It was the same type of wall everywhere I looked, 
except for the one with the window to the right of me; 
it had several patterns on it outlined by white paint. 
It would seem that I was in the hospital.
I tried to sit myself up, but to no avail. 
Most of my body was bandaged up, or in a cast. 
Probably because of that damn car crash.
A figure beside my bed caught my eye. 
Her head was placed on the table beside me, sleeping. 
Bandages were wrapped around her head, her left arm and abdomen. 
I recognized her almost instantly.
Auburn
Thank god. She’s alive.
A nurse enters the room, and upon seeing my open eyes, she ran back outside. 
Presumably to get a doctor.
I look towards the sleeping Auburn again, and softly, I call her name. 
She responds with a slight growl, 
before sitting up and wiping the sleep off her eyes.
“What time is it?” She asked, still half asleep.
“Its time for you to wake up.” 
I replied her with the same reply I give her every time. 
She froze when she heard it. 
She looks at me, her face a mix of relief and disbelief.
“…Abel?” Her voice was hoarse now. 
Her eyes watering. I give a slow nod.
She holds my face close to hers. 
She’s muttering a mix of apologies and thanks under her breath. 
She calls my name again and again, 
as if to confirm that she isn’t dreaming and that I’m still alive.
“Yeah. I’m back.”
We stay like that for a very long time, even after the doctor enters the room.
