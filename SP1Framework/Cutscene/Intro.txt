I jolt awake. 
I blinked, feeling the motion of my eyelids moving, 
but I wasn't even sure if my eyes were open. 
It wasn't until I held a hand to my forehead that I confirmed that they were.
Where am I?
I tried to stand, doing so with some difficulty. 
There was nothing to tell me where I am. 
Everything is the same shade of black. Like a void. 
It seems I'm the only one here. 
I can't seem to remember anything apart from my name.
All of a sudden, wave of unintelligible voices, loud noises, 
unstable emotions and flashbacks crashed into me like a tsunami. 
My effort to remain standing was almost immediately crushed, 
shouting and screaming as they enter my head. 
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. Just as suddenly, it stops.
I was on my knees, with my hands on the ground, breathing heavily.
What was that? What did I just see? 
Warm tears trickled down my face. I hadn't realized I had been crying. 
I tried to stand again. 
There was a darkened patch around my chest. It wasn't there before. 
Neither was the walls that appeared on either side of me. 
Neither was that gate that stood before me. 
It was just a plain metal gate, standing atop nothing. It beckons me.
I can only move forward. I need answers.
